# ECOR-1606
**Course Objectives:**

The course introduces the general sequence of steps in solving problems using computer programs.
Students will learn to analyze problems (ie. Identify the objectives, the inputs and the outputs to
produce), to derive a pseudo-code detailing the sequence of operations to solve the problem, to verify
the proposed solution before converting it to a C++ program. Examples will include simple numerical
methods, sorting arrays or extracting data from arrays ...

**Learning Outcomes:**

1.State the objective of a problem (ie. the results to produce)

2.Extract the inputs and the assumptions from the problem description

3.Formulate the solution as an algorithm or pseudo-code, using assignments, conditional statement
and loops

4.List scenarios to test their solution

5.Write simple C++ programs with functions, arrays

6.Convert the algorithm to a C++ program
