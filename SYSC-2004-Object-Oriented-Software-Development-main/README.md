# SYSC-2004
**Course Objectives:**

Designing and implementing small-scale programs as communities of collaborating
objects, using a dynamically-typed or statically-typed programming language.
Fundamental concepts: classes, objects, encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance,
polymorphism. Iterative, incremental development and test-driven development.

**Learning Outcomes:**

1. Identify the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (classes,
objects, encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism).
2. To implement small-scale programs as communities of interacting (collaborating)
objects
3. To apply lightweight, modern techniques commonly used during object-oriented
software development (iterative, incremental development; test-driven
development).
4. To draw basic class and object diagrams.
5. To apply their object-oriented knowledge to developing simple graphical user
interfaces.
