**Course Objectives:**

Imperative programming paradigm has been widely used in practice for various applications.
The objective of this course is to understand the concepts that underlie most imperative
programming languages and be able to use this knowledge to learn new languages. The course
will deal with designing and implementing small-scale programs, in particular the use of C
programming language. Specific concepts to be covered include assignment and state, types and 
variables, static and dynamic typing; memory management and object lifetimes: static allocation,
automatic allocation in activation frames, dynamic allocation; function argument passing;
recursion; and data structures: dynamic arrays, linked lists. The course also is to prepare students
to undertake a course that provides a thorough introduction to object-oriented programming
principles.

**Learning Outcomes:**

1. understand several constructs provided by imperative programming languages that
determine the flow of control when a program is executed;
2. understand several constructs provided by imperative programming languages for
structuring data;
3. be able to trace short programs written in an imperative programming language and
• explain what happens, step-by-step, as the computer executes each statement;
• visualize how code execution changes the program's state; in other words, draw
diagrams that depict the program's global variables, its activation frames
(containing function parameters and local variables) and memory that has been
allocated from the heap and is accessed through pointers.
4. be able to design, code, test and visualize the execution of functions that operate on two
fundamental data structures: the dynamic (resizable) array and the pointer-based singlylinked list.
5. be able to construct simple recursive functions, specify simple recursive algorithms,
convert these algorithms into recursive functions, and visualize the execution of recursive
code.
